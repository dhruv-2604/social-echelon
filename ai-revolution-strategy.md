```python
class VisualSuccessPredictor:
    def predict(image):
        features = extract_visual_features(image)
        engagement = model.predict(features)
        return {
            'expected_performance': engagement,
            'optimization_suggestions': generate_improvements()
        }
```

### 2. Algorithm Simulator
```python
class AlgorithmSimulator:
    def simulate_reach(content):
        return {
            'hour_1_reach': 2847,
            'hour_24_reach': 48291,
            'explore_chance': 0.73,
            'optimal_time': "7:23 PM"
        }
```

### 3. Autonomous Agent
```python
class AutonomousContentAgent:
    def run_24_7(self):
        while True:
            trending = detect_trends()
            ideas = generate_concepts(trending)
            content = create_content(ideas)
            optimized = personalize(content)
            schedule(optimized)
```
