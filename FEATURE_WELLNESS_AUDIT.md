1. **Urgency** - No countdown timers or "limited time"
2. **Comparison** - No "others are doing better"
3. **Shame** - No "you're behind" messaging
4. **FOMO** - No "you're missing out"
5. **Always-on** - No expectation of constant availability

- **User stress reduction** (survey)
- **Creator sustainability score**
- **Platform engagement during off-hours** (lower is better!)
